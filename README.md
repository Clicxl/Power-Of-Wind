# Power Generated By Wind Energy

Wind energy is a renewable resource that converts the kinetic energy of moving air into mechanical power using wind turbines, which is then transformed into electricity. The amount of power produced by a windmill depends on several factors, including wind speed, air density, and the size of the area swept by the turbine blades. The standard formula to calculate the power generated by a wind turbine is:

    `P = 1/2 *  ρ * A * v^3`

Where:
 - P is the total power generated per unit hour (in MWh)
 - ρ is the air density at the given height 
 - A is the total area swept by the mill blades
 - v is the velocity or the wind speed

 This formula shows that wind power increases dramatically with wind speed, making site selection and turbine design crucial for maximizing energy production
